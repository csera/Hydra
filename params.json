  "body": "﻿Hydra is a browser-based tool for high-throughput screening still under development.\r\nIt is an open-source project which makes use of 3Dmol.js for displaying molecules\r\nand the Webix code library for general GUI generation and functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to keep your data private, don't worry: your files are not uploaded\r\nto any servers. \"Uploading\" files only places them in the browser's local instance.\r\n\r\nThis README will be updated as development proceeds.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n== Completed Features ==\r\n- Display of up to 18 different compounds at once in an adjustable grid of 3Dmol\r\n  instances\r\n  - Grid may be resized in terms of number of viewers and in terms of raw pixels\r\n  - Exact number of simultaneous instances may fluctuate.  It is usually ~16\r\n- Structural representations\r\n  - Cartoon, line (double/triple bonds supported), ball & stick, cross, sphere\r\n- Surface representations\r\n  - Van der Waals, molecular, solvent accessible, solvent excluded\r\n- Fetching of compound information for compounds in the ZINC database\r\n  - Uses \"boutique shards\" subset (subset #47)\r\n  - Vendor list creation\r\n  - Displayed properties:\r\n      - \"Compounds Overview\": ZINC ID, IUPAC name, number of atoms, number of bonds\r\n      - \"Compound Details\": LogP, molecular mass, nubmer of H-bond donors, number of\r\n        H-bond acceptors, SMILES code, 2D bond-line representation, vendor list\r\n- Processing of raw molecular docking simulation output\r\n  - Filters uploaded files based upon a user-inputted filename template\r\n  - Concatenates ligand and protein files then places them in the main workspace\r\n\r\n- Please see 3Dmol.js's documentation for more extensive detail on the following:\r\n  - Tranlations, rotation, and zoom with mouse and touchscreen\r\n  - Non-exhaustive list of supported filetypes:\r\n    - .mol2, .pdb, .cif, .sdf\r\n\r\n\r\n== Basic Usage ==\r\n- Upload files into Hydra via the \"Upload Files\" button\r\n  - Multiple files may be uploaded at once via shift+click and ctrl+click\r\n  - Uploaded files will appear in the file list\r\n- Items in the file list may be reorded via drag and drop\r\n  - Multiple items can be selected at once and removed via \"Delete Data\"\r\n- Uploaded files may be sent to a viewer by entering the corresponding viewer's\r\n  coordinates in the \"Col\" and \"Row\" fields via double-click\r\n  - The viewer coordinates are displayed in Col,Row format in the bottom left of\r\n    each 3Dmol instance\r\n  - Once all desired coordinates have been set, press the \"Upload Data\" button\r\n  - Please note that changing the coordinates of an already loaded molecule will \r\n    clear it from its original viewer and reload it with the default display \r\n    settings in the new viewer\r\n- The number of viewers in the grid may be resized via the \"Grid Controls\" pane\r\n- To change the display settings of a given compound, navigate to the \"Viewer Controls\"\r\n  panel which can be accessed via the multiview tab-bar on the bottom left\r\n  - Select a viewer to make \"active\" by simply clicking on it. It will be highlighted\r\n    whilst \"active\"\r\n  - Display mode may only be altered for the ACTIVE VIEWER\r\n  - New display modes will be applied soon as a change in the settings is detected\r\n- Using the file processor\r\n  - The file processor GUI will open upon pressing the labeled button\r\n  - All files outputted by a simulation may be uploaded via \"Upload Raw Files\"\r\n  - Follow the in-program instructions for filtering relevant files\r\n    - NOTE: if no filters are applied, nothing will happen\r\n  - Confirm that all relevant files are present and that all other files have been \r\n    screened out then press \"OK\"\r\n    - Return and modify the filters if not\r\n  - The ligand files will have \"ATOM\" tags replaced with \"HETATM\" then be appended\r\n    to the protein files\r\n  - Pressing \"OK\" will clear the file processor tables, add them to the main Hydra\r\n    interface, and close (technically, hide) the processor popup.  Filters will,\r\n    however, not be cleared and will still be there if the processor is reopened.\r\n\r\n\r\n== System requirements ==\r\n\r\nHydra has been developed primarily on Firefox and Chrome, but it should also work\r\nin most other browsers as long as they support WebGL and Javascript.\r\nIt also works well on mobile devices and has been tested on Chrome for Android.\r\n\r\nWhile it may still work, Internet Explorer is not supported at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Troubleshooting ==\r\n\r\nWhy won't my file load?\r\nIf you are running Hydra locally, please note that some browsers (eg Google Chrome)\r\nhave strict security settings which block uploading local files to a locally run \r\ninstance as a Same-Origin-Policy violation (null source and null destination).\r\nPlease run this on a server or from a different browser (eg Firefox)\r\nIf you are running into a different problem, please verify that your filetype is \r\nsupported by 3Dmol.js.",
