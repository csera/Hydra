1vhr_noH...
Was the output of a docking program.
Has been modified by my PI from the original version with heteroatom tags as file would not display at all in 3Dmol without these tags.
This shows odd pink/magenta structures all over the molecule that persist in all views except for cartoon.

2POR.pdb
Test protein. Displays properly as a trimer

47_top.mol2
Is a concatenation of 3 separate files outputted by a docking program.
This will display, but it will only display one of the molecules (the first, I think).
The 3 files with similar names are the individual compounds that I pulled out of this file.

cry5B
Both the pdb and mol2 seem to load without a problem.

lig_charged.mol
The console output suggests that 3Dmol liked this file and is displaying it properly (well as an 'xyz').
However, nothing actually shows up and the view is not changed at all (ie no repositioning).

lig_charged.mol2
Causes the tokens[5] is undefined error

lig_charged.pdb
Similar to the .mol version in terms of the console output and what can be seen.
Interestingly though, the viewer will zoom out upon accepting this file.

shp2_noH.pdb
Another outputted file from a docking program.
This causes almost identical behavior to lig_charged.pdb.
The only difference isd that the camera has now also moved up and to the left as well as zoomed out.

SSH1_charged.mol2
tokens[5] error

SSH1_charged.pdb
Essentially identical to shp2_noH.pdb.
The camera moved in the same way; it just ended at a slightly different spot.
