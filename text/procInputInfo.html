<p>
In order to correctly display protein-ligand data together when separate files are
outputted (eg the output of DOCK), protein files must be concatenated with the
corresponding ligand files. Please input the indicated information below using
the following fields, encapsulated in square brackets, as needed:<br/>
<ul>
   <li><strong>[*]</strong> -  Wild card field.  Will accept any text (eg a compound unique name).</li>
   <li><strong>[ligID]</strong> - The ID of the ligand. This is expected to be a dynamic field
      linking each unique protein and ligand docked pair.
   </li>
</ul>
Separate each field and other name components with a period ".". Please note that
file names must be formatted with parts dilimited by a period "." otherwise this
parser will not work. Additionally, filters are <strong>case sensitive</strong>
and name components/fields containing any "<strong>.</strong>" characters will be
broken up into multiple fields.<br/>
Sets of files will be identified by matching [ligID] field values.
Text not encapsulated in [] will be treated as a constant present in all relevant
files.<br/>
Note that file type endings (eg '.pdb') are not required but should be included to
avoid errors.<br/>
Ex: [*].[*].3_top.[ligID].final_pose.amber.pdb<br/>
<ul>
   <li>Will identify a1.noH.3_top.1.final_pose.amber.pdb as a protein file paired with ligand 1.</li>
   <li>It will not accept noH.3_top.1.final_pose.amber.pdb.</li>
</ul>
