<p>
Please input the indicated information below.  Protein files will be concatenated with
ligand files for display together.<br/>
Use the following field encapsulated in square brackets as needed:<br/>
<ul>
   <li><strong>[*]</strong> -  Wild card field.  Will accept any text (eg a compound unique name).</li>
   <li><strong>[ligID]</strong> - The ID of the ligand. This is expected to be a dynamic field
      linking each unique protein and ligand docked pair.
   </li>
</ul>
Separate each field and other name components with a period ".".  Please note that your file
names must be formatted to have the parts separated by "." otherwise this parser will not
work. Additioanlly, filters are <strong>case sensitive</strong>.<br/>
Sets of files will be identified by matching [ligID]. Fields <strong>MAY NOT</strong> contain
any "<strong>.</strong>" characters.  If any [*] field is broken up by "<b>.</b>" chars, please
use the field multiple times.<br/>
Text not encapsulated in [] will be treated as a constant present in all relevant files.<br/>
Note that file type endings (eg '.pdb') are not required, but not including them may result in
errors not caught by the program.<br/>
Ex: [*].[*].3_top.[ligRef].final_pose.amber.pdb<br/>
<ul>
   <li>Will identify a1.noH.3_top.1.final_pose.amber.pdb as a protein file paired with ligand 1.</li>
   <li>It will not accept noH.3_top.1.final_pose.amber.pdb.</li>
</ul>
